# Overview
Mobile interface for parents to learn more about and thereby improve their children's sleeping habits. This application displays our four metrics of time in bed, movement, bed exits, and bed wetting collected by our hardware product. It is part of a feasibility study for Serta Simmmons Bedding (SSB), as such  it features a complete user interface to view the data and logon, but is lacking in its algorithms and notifications. The application will allow the hardware and user experience to be tested as part of product development for SSB.

# Getting Started
Clone the repository and run ```yarn``` to install the packages and dependencies. The application is run using expo, see [expo installation instructions.](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/installation/).
